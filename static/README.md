# Static data includes

This folder contains the static arrays and lookup tables included throughout the code. 

- [`translation.bin`](translation.bin): a mapping from letter indices (`a` having index 0) to an internal
code representing transitions in [crawdad's trie](https://docs.rs/crawdad/). 
- [`dart_base.bin`](dart_base.bin): [double-array trie](https://www.linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/) base array
generated by [crawdad](https://docs.rs/crawdad/). 
- [`dart_check.bin`](dart_check.bin): [double-array trie](https://www.linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/) check
array generated by [crawdad](https://docs.rs/crawdad/). 
- [`entropy.txt`](entropy.txt): table of all 8-bit values in a random order. Used to increase apparent
entropy in input data. 
- [`syllables.txt`](syllables.txt): all 256 syllables used when encoding data. 

The binary arrays were dumped using the code found in [`trie_dumper`](../trie_dumper/).
