# Trie Binary Dumper

The binary arrays detailed in [`static`](../static/) were generated by [crawdad](https://docs.rs/crawdad/)
and dumped using the code found here. 

This is a somewhat sketchy procedure since the arrays are not publicly exposed by crawdad's API. To avoid
having to fork crawdad's source, we therefore rely on UB to transmute crawdad's trie type into an identical
type that we control. This is UB since the layout of structs is undefined (and may even be
nondeterministic), and so there is no way to guarantee that our trie type has the same layout as crawdad's.
To attempt to detect a layout mismatch, we employ some known values as canaries; if these checks fail, you
may have to modify crawdad's source to reproduce our binary data.
